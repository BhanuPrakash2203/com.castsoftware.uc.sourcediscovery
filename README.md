# Source Code Discovery Tool
The tool is used to do the Source Code Discovery before injecting it for CAST Analysis. This helps in
 * Unzipping the source code provided by customer
 * Cleaning up the source code
 * Visualizing the technologies and calculating the amount of source code provided by customer in terms of LOC and number of files
 * Calculating the amount of SQL artifacts (Tables, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Views, Funtions) procided by customer and giving an idea if any duplicate artifacts are there.

## Installation
* No installation is required as the tool is in the form of an executable(.exe). 
* Download the latest release of the Source Discovery Tool from https://github.com/CAST-Extend/com.castsoftware.uc.sourcediscovery/releases
